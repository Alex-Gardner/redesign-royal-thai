or a truly refreshing fried rice, our renditions of the favorites won't disappoint.

Our flavorful dishes truly utilize every contingent of the "five basic tastes": salt, sweet, bitter, sour, and umami. We take pride in blending these distinct flavors into something uniquely delicious.

Thai cuisine varies regionally. Various communities heavily utilize differing flavor profiles and ingredients in their dishes.

The cooking styles developed in Northern Thailand, for instance tend to use complex mixtures of aromatic herbs and vegetables resulting in pleasantly bitter and tart tastes.

The regions of the northeast (often called Isaan) are renowned for their remoteness and subsequently have flavor profiles not found elsewhere. Dishes from this region tend to forgo the usual strong salty flavor and instead often feature limes to add sourness to the savory profile of the base ingredients.

The southern area of the country utilizes the nearness of the ocean to augment dishes with fresh seafood. It is renowned for extremely spicy and salty cuisine featuring curry with coconut milk.

Central Thailand's cuisine is most accurately descsribed as a combination of various styles: from either the aforementioned regional Thai cusine to other areas of greater southeast Asia. For instance, the national dish of Pad Thai is based on dishes brought by Chinese traders centuries ago.
